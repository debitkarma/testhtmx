# testhtmx

This is a toy project to get to learn how HTMX works. Working with `bottle` as a web server, though I may eventually switch to flask/asgi to see how that could work after this is up and running.

Also, I'm learning `uv` with this project. It's _fast_! Gotta get back on the Rust train eventually!
